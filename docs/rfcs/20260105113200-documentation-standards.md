# RFC: Documentation Standards

**ZID**: 20260105113200

## Summary
Establish a consistent documentation standard across the ZID-suite projects, ensuring all tools have standardized READMEs, release notes, and RFC structures.

## Motivation
To ensure professional-grade documentation that is easy to navigate, especially as the ecosystem grows. Consistency in badges, TOCs, and navigation links improves developer experience.

## Standards Proposed
1. **Badges**: Standard Version and License badges at the top.
2. **TOC**: mandatory Table of Contents for READMEs over 50 lines.
3. **Navigation**: "Return to Top" links for all major sections.
4. **Examples**: Practical step-by-step breakdowns for core tools.
5. **Ecosystem**: Explicit links to the Kardenwort ecosystem.

## Implementation Details
- Applied these standards to the `obsidian-zid-wikilink` project as a baseline.
- Future projects will use the root `README.md` as a template.
